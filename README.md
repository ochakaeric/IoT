# Air Quality Monitoring Task Using LinkIt One Board

Goals:
1. Collect air quality data through the use of LinkIt One (MT2502A) with the help of SGX VZ89TE I2C sensor.
	* LinkIt One Board: https://www.seeedstudio.com/LinkIt-ONE-p-2017.html
	* Sensor: https://sgx.cdistore.com/products/detail/micsvz89te-sgx-sensortech/598202/

2. Publishing the collected data to a MQTT Broker for visualization purposes.
	* MQTT Broker Website: https://thingsboard.io
	* MQTT Broker LogIn Page: http://demo.thingsboard.io/login

# Requirements
1. Mediatek LinkIt One board

2. Well soldered SGX VZ89TE I2C sensor so as to connect to the LinkIt One board

3. Arduino IDE
	* MacOS: https://docs.labs.mediatek.com/resource/linkit-one/en/getting-started/get-started-on-os-x
	* Windows: https://docs.labs.mediatek.com/resource/linkit-one/en/getting-started/get-started-on-windows

4. Necessary Libraries

5. MQTT broker (Whichever Platform You Find Useful)

6. Internet Connection

# Things we did but not covered here:
